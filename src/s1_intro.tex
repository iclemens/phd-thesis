The vestibular system is composed of two parts: the otoliths and the semicircular canals.

The otoliths are sensitive to linear accelearion with can in turn be cause by gravity and interial forces.

These are therefore important for the perception of: verticality, heading and displacement.

The canals are sensitive for rotational velocity and are important for 


Discuss TVOR / RVOR and relation with otoliths / canals. Neural mechanism?

Paper 2 - Updating of visual stimuli across lateral translation



Overlapping themes:
  Vestibular, only otoliths; gravity (paper 1), linear acceleration (paper 2 to 4)
  Visual, orientation judgment (paper 1), updating (paper 2), self-motion (paper 3, 4)
