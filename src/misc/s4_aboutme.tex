He then started work on a master's degree in Biology at the Radboud University Nijmegen. As part of this master's degree Ivar did his research internship on the \emph{integration of pre- and post-vergence target distance cues} with Pieter Medendorp at the Nijmegen Institute for Cognition and Information (NICI, later renamed to the Donders Centre for Cognition). Ivar then switched to the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuro-imaging (DCCN) for another research internship. This time he worked with Ole Jensen and Saskia Haegens on \emph{homeostatic plasticity in the somatosensory cortex}. After completing his master's degree in 2009, Ivar started his PhD project at he Donders Centre for Cognition. The results of this PhD project are contained within this thesis.
