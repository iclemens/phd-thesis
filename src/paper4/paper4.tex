\small {\bf Abstract}
Previously, we have shown that the eye movements that typically accompany self-motion are used to augment self-motion perception. As fixation depth modulates the amplitude of these eye movements, it should be taken into account for a veridical oculomotor estimate of self-motion. To investigate whether the brain compensates for fixation depth, we had  participants ($n = 8$) judge self-motion during different eye movement conditions in the absence of full-field optic flow.  In a 2-AFC task, participants indicated whether the second of two successive passive lateral whole-body translations was longer or shorter than the first. At the start of each movement participants fixated either a nearby or a far away target, which was either body stationary or world stationary during the translation interval. Results show that the perceived translations were shorter for nearby world-fixed gaze compared to far away world-fixed gaze, indicating that eye movements are not properly scaled in self-motion perception. Together with the observation that self-motion perception is not affected by the depth of a body stationary fixation target, we conclude that eye movements are merely a rudimentary cue to self-motion, with a compensation for fixation depth that is partial at best.
